<!--Lab - Restaurant with HTML-->

<!--Building a basic web application for a fictional restaurant.-->
<!--You are only providing the HTML right now. We will style later.-->

<!--You are going to build a 3-page web application with the following requirements:-->

<!--Must have three pages – Landing, Menu, Now Hiring-->
<!--There should be three links on each page that allows a user to navigate between all three of them-->
<!--Landing Page-->
<!--Needs to have an image-->

<!--Menu page-->
<!--Must have a table consisting of the following information for 5 items-->
<!--Name of the item-->
<!--Description of the item-->
<!--Price of the item-->
<!--Use the built-in HTML table attributes for styling.-->


<!--Now Hiring page-->
<!--Must use a form with the following inputs – make sure to use the appropriate HTML attributes based on the following expectations:-->
<!--First name is not optional. It must contain at least 1 character and cannot be longer than 20.-->
<!--Last name – not everyone has one. If completed, it must contain at least 1 character and cannot be longer than 20.-->
<!--Address 1 is a must.-->
<!--Address 2 is only needed if more info needs to be provided by the applicant.-->
<!--City is important but should be able to be filled out with less than 30 characters.-->
<!--State – with at least 3 options in a two character format.-->
<!--Age is required. Potential employees must be at least 21 and unfortunately, they cannot be older than 99 years old.-->
<!--Phone numbers need to be consistent and all applicants must submit one. HR has recommended that phone numbers follow a 111-222-3333 formatting and users will probably need a reminder.-->
<!--Email data should be verified for all applicants and though you cannot verify they are accurate, you should still be able to put a safeguard in place to verify if data matches a standard US email address.-->
<!--A password is required for all accounts and must consist of an 8-12 character pattern which includes at least one number, one special symbol, one uppercase character and one lowercase character.-->
<!--Married – radios with the assumption all applicants are single.-->
<!--Favorite colors – five checkboxes-->
<!--More Info – text area with room for 4 lines of entries and a max number of thirty characters.-->
<!--Two buttons – submit and reset-->
